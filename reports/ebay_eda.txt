 For each item, what is the relationship between bids, bid time, and the closing price? Does this differ by length of the auction, opening bid, or by bidder rating?

The bidders with the best ratings, bid on day 3, notthing like a gurantee sale.

The 7 day auction starts off with smallest open bid but ends up with the higest closing price.

The more days you have to auction in item, the more likely you are to achieve a profit.
Should I start an auction with a higher or lower opening bid (to attract more bidders)?
Lower bids gurantee more bidders which increase over time, unless someone over bids to early
